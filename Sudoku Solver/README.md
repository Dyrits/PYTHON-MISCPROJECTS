## PERSONAL PROJECTS > Sudoku Solver 
The Sudoku Solver can be used to solve any grid.  
The grid needs to be typed manually as a list of lists.  
It is using a backtracking method, selecting the first valid option for every cell, and going to the next when. When a cell doesn't have any valid option, the program is going back to the previous cell, until a valid option is found (then go forward again).

### About this project
#### Details | Comments
This is the first project in Python I had made after 3 days starting to learn programming. I wanted to do it without using any external libraries, and didn't much about them anyway at that time. The way I am naming the variables and functions is not very conventional, since I didn't know about that neither.

##### Update (02/05/2020)
This project has been reworked in a new version to be a lot more efficient and a lot more pythonic.
